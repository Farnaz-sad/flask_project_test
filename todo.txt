Feedback on Your Code ðŸŽ‰

    Good Aspects:
        Modular Design: Your code splits the responsibilities into routes cleanly (/search and /search_results), which is a good practice.
        Dynamic Query Building: Youâ€™ve handled filtering in the search_results function by dynamically adding conditions based on user input. This shows you're thinking about flexibility in code design.
        Form Handling: Using both GET and POST methods effectively for different parts of the workflow (form rendering and processing).

    Suggestions for Improvement:
        Default Values in Routes: Using "none" as a placeholder for missing keyword or author values works, but you could make it more user-friendly by validating the form inputs before redirecting and displaying a helpful message if neither field is filled.
        Error Handling: While you have an exception handler, you could improve user feedback when an error occurs by rendering an error page or redirecting to a generic error route instead of just showing "Something went wrong".
        Code Readability: Your code is well-structured, but adding comments explaining the purpose of each block would make it easier to understand for others (or for yourself later on).
        Template Integration: If results.html has some basic formatting, you could add enhancements like pagination for search results or filtering options directly on the results page.

    Overall, your code is solid and ready for more advanced concepts! ðŸŒŸ

Next Task: Implementing User Authentication

User authentication is a critical part of almost any web application. It will give you a chance to practice secure coding, database relationships, and integrating user-based features.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of what weâ€™ll implement:

    User Registration:
        A route where users can register with a username, email, and password.
        Passwords should be hashed for security (use the bcrypt library).

    User Login:
        A login route where users can authenticate.
        Youâ€™ll use Flaskâ€™s session management to handle logged-in users.

    Protected Routes:
        Create a route that only logged-in users can access (e.g., /dashboard).

    Logout:
        Implement a logout feature to clear the session.

Step 1: Set Up Your User Model

Start by creating a User model in your database:

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt

db = SQLAlchemy()
bcrypt = Bcrypt()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(150), nullable=False, unique=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(150), nullable=False, unique=True)
    password = db.Column(db.String(150), nullable=False)

Next steps:

    Create the necessary routes for registration and login.
    Test the registration functionality first to ensure users are saved in the database.

Do you want a step-by-step guide for the whole authentication flow, or would you like to explore it yourself and ask for feedback as you go? ðŸ˜Š

Youâ€™re absolutely rightâ€”learning Git is essential for any developer! Since you're already building a project, it's the perfect time to integrate Git into your workflow. Here's the plan:
Why Learn Git Now?

    Version Control: Track changes to your code as you develop new features like search, authentication, or anything else.
    Collaboration: Get familiar with tools used in team-based development (even if you're working solo for now).
    GitHub Presence: Start uploading your projects to GitHub to build a professional portfolio.

What Weâ€™ll Cover:
Step 1: Basic Git Workflow

    Initialize a repository.
    Track files, commit changes, and understand .gitignore.
    Push your local repository to GitHub.

Step 2: Branching

    Work with branches for different features (e.g., auth-feature or search-feature).
    Merge branches safely into your main branch.

Step 3: GitHub Collaboration

    Learn how to create a repository on GitHub and push code there.
    Work with Pull Requests (PRs) to simulate team workflows.

Step 4: Advanced Git

    Undo changes, resolve merge conflicts, and manage a clean commit history.

Task: Setting Up Git for Your Current Project

Letâ€™s start with the basics:

    Install Git: Confirm Git is installed on your system (git --version).
    Initialize Your Repo:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Flask library app"

Create a GitHub Repository:

    Go to GitHub and create a new repo.
    Follow the instructions to link your local repo to GitHub:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
